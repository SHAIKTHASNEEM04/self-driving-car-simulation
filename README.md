# self-driving-car-simulation
This project is a basic self-driving car simulation built using Python and the Pygame library. It serves as an educational introduction to the core concepts of autonomous vehicles such as:  Car movement and rotation  Obstacle detection using simulated sensors  Lane following  Rule-based or AI-based driving logic  .
